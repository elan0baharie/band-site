    <p>Weezer is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1992, consisting of Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, guitar), Patrick Wilson (drums), Brian Bell (guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Scott Shriner (bass guitar, backing vocals). Weezer has sold 9.2 million albums in the US and over 17 million worldwide.[1]

    After signing to Geffen Records in 1993, the band released its debut self-titled album, also known as the Blue Album, in 1994. Backed by successful music videos for the singles "Buddy Holly", "Undone â€“ The Sweater Song" and "Say It Ain't So", the Blue Album became a triple-platinum success. Weezer's second album, Pinkerton (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and Pinkerton are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for Pinkerton, bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.</p>
